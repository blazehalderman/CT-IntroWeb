    <p>My <em>favorite</em> place to visit is Costa Rica. It's lush green environment and the <a href="http://costarica.com/wildlife/" target="_blank">wildlife</a> surrounding the area make it twice as enjoyable.</p>
    <p>To be more specific, I like to visit the <a href="http://www.arenal.net/arenal-volcano-overview.htm" target="_blank">Arenal Volcano</a> which is more in the northern area of Costa Rica.</p>
    <p>During my visit to Costa Rica, I also was able to visit the <a href="http://www.anywherecostarica.com/destinations/habitat/beach" target="_blank">beaches</a>. The beach is most <strong>intense</strong> because of how hot it gets, but is most relieving when you enter the into the ocean.</p>
    <p>Overall, I had a great time during my visit to Costa Rica and hopefully one day will return.</p>
